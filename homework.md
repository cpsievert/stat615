### Homework 1 (due 10 Sep in class)

This homework covers two topics: Bayesian hypothesis testing (question 1) and regularized regression (questions 2-4). For the regularized regression problems, we assume the data are of the form y=Xb+e where e~N(0,s^2).

1. Derive equation (4) in [Sharpening Ockham's Razor on a Bayesian Strop]({$BASE_PATH}/papers/ockham.pdf).
2. Show that independent normal priors on regression components lead to the ridge estimator on page 5 of [Ridge Regression in Practice](${BASE_PATH}/papers/Ridge_Regression_in_Practice.pdf).
3. Show that independent [Laplace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution) priors on regression coefficients lead to the LASSO estimator on page 1 of [Bayesian LASSO](http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~casella/Papers/Lasso.pdf).
4. Derive the form of the prior distribution for the [elastic net estimator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_net_regularization).
